last night i was in gastric pain again, maybe because i ate cake that mom's made
i tried to just stay in bed, but it doesn't work, because it hurts whenever i lay down
so i have to force myself to in a sit position
then i commit to have a full rest, because the day before i tried to wake up before i feel i got full rest, i can't even concentrate to study
that is why i just full sleep, i awake at almost 3pm, then i start study. i will try to journal everyday. so before winding down, i will journal what ever it is
today just simple like that, we will see what will  tommorow be
thank you God for today
