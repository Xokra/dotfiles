tonight is the first night i go full learning,
last night i try my hardest to fully sleep even though i feel my gastric ached, so that is why i force my sleep to sleep until i am fully recovered,
I woke up at 11.30am then do my usual, and i don't have any reward or entertainment,
i read the 'lean startup' book for the first time
my mindset is clearer to become a billionaire,
i feel fulfill to do this
hopefully i can be consistent forever
