last night i ate at 6.30pm and sleep at 10.30pm
i feel my gastric aches when i sleep that night
so i drink the polysilane, i have to drank it twice, at the middle of the night and almost in the morning
i still trying to fix my sleep schedule, so because i have a heaadache before i sleep again yesterday at 9am and wake up at almost 3pm
i ate 2 panadol to help me sleep
and in the morning because i'm awake almost the whole night but still force myself to stay in bed until morning, i feel sleepy only almost in the morning, so i wake up almost at 9am
then i notice i got diarrhea in the morning, but i still force myself to study, then until i went to the toilet for the second time i ate the 'entrostop' medicine
and because of that medicine and my diarrhea, i feel really sleepy, and really force myself to study, until i my brain can't think of anything and i get straight to bed and rest, and at 3 pm i'm awake continue study
then i try to eat at 4.30pm, because i want to know if the problem of my gastric is the hour of my dinner before sleep, so i want to know will it be a problem tonight for my gastric.

and because of the out of the schedule of everything that i do today, i try to listen to my body and brain if it is ready to study or i'm too forcing it again.
so it is between that and the death note anime, because it is the anime that in for my reward system after i study so much, and with watching that helps me to get back to study, i tried to watch other thing, but it makes my brain not inline to thinking about study
i'm planning not to wake myself at the schedule of 5.15am, because my sleep pattern still not right, but i will try my best to stay in bed and in the morning I also have to take my brother to school and pick up kak apri to help my mom's baking
so this is my journal, so thank you god for still giving me a chance to wake up today and hustle. thank you for my mom and brother of still in their activities. thank you for all the knowledge today. hopefully i can keep growing. amin
