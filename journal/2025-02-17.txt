today we start with our third time wake up then exercise with our little brother.
the new breathing technique is something else.
you feel very stress in the middle of the day, maybe because it is one more time your first time.
then after a nap you are back to study again.
i'm greatful while mom is away, I can manage for the food and take care of my brother
I'm greatful I don't give up. now let's do this thing consistently. start from the bottom is okay then not start at all.
thank you for journaling again.
