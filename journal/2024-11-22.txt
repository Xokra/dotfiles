today i wake up at 5.30 then straight to meditate
after meditate i push up then eat then drive onad to his school
it is a great morning routine to meditate then exercise
i feel my brain function better, because afterward i do the brain training with easier
then i search for what books to read
i got the list and start from around before 12 i started to collectively remember what i've learned
then start my program 12.30 eat while reading books until 2pm,after that i take a nap
and i tried to sleep again because when i got to sleep the alarm went off, but when i tried to sleep again i feel more heavy
so i think tomorrow i will only take one time of 26 minutes nap
and i feel amazing to learn, but then 4pm anime time, after 5pm start to learn again, i understand it but really hard to memorize, so i force it
i think maybe my energy is low, or maybe it is because of the anime, i will try again tomorrow and see, if it still the same i will try another thing
i didn't watch movie or anime for the free time,
i open tik tok, until 9.15, we'll see tomorrow if it affects anything
but i'm super sleepy right now
its a great day today
thank you God for today habbit building, i learn a lot, i hope i can be consistent tomorrow
first day of journaling, let's go!
goodnight
