i was thinking to make my new project(this is my first project, and this is for everything including next projects) to attract customers and do freelance as html&css while i will continue my learning of js, but for now i need money, and as nvim user, i think there will be repetitive task/codes, even from zero, maybe i can make command shortcut for such code, than i can edit them?(what i use right now is nvim, lazygit,tmux,stow for my dotfiles, haven't done any project yet)or what is the better approach?i need you to give me the step by step everything, and i already have lazy.nvim for my lua/plugins/example.luaso i think i want that i can maybe from you different style of axes (simplicity vs richness, classic/traditional vs modern/trendy, informative/functional vs emotional/experiential)that i have many variaties to show to my clients with each of them stands out and better than 99% of other competitors.(glass morphism options is great, what other things that can make me stands out?)

but hold your horses,
and i saw that my files are too big just one chat(as you are limited by just a comment, so my plan is i want you to strategically answer one type of thing that you need to do and next you have to strategically prompt me for a newly chat ai so the ai(other claude.ai) can continue the other than you've already done(tell the ai what you've done in detail, so they can continue your work, and tell them in what part of the work are already finish, and that newly ai should continue the next one thing(so it wouldn't get the text limit per message, so each newly claude.ai should do one thing at a time, while continue check mark the things that have been done. and it also prompt another for the other newly claude.ai. so it can be a chain of responds through different newly claude ai and so on. again the repetitive for the prompt is:

1. understand what the previous claude.ai have done(maybe in steps/part/phase)

2. tell them the whole structure of steps and what steps we are in and done(ex: "out of 5 steps(show it what are those steps are), you are in steps 2"(not to me but in the prompt for the next claude.ai)), so the next claude.ai know what step are they in and the only one thing they need to do.
3. make them prompt the same thing for the next claude.ai.

again one thing at a newly claude.ai at a time, and so on and so on and so on until the steps completed!) while understanding all i will give you here(it is the past for the new ai), so we will smartly use the message efficiently in just one full new ai chat(new claude.ai chat) for the next and the next.

also i will ask you to prompt me to the next and like that until everything is finished.

and i like how you use this "local function map(mode, lhs, rhs, opts)
local options = {
noremap = true,
silent = true,

}
if opts then

    options = vim.tbl_extend("force", options, opts)

end
vim.keymap.set(mode, lhs, rhs, options)
end"
okay that's all, i will give you my codes now:
